# Switch Piano

Switch Piano is a microcontroller project written in C and simulated using Tinkercad (COVID-19 -> No hands on practicals at uni, sigh...). The circuit can be viewed at the following link: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/idAXq9fzEPD.

The end result is 8 buttons, which represent 8 piano keys (excluding the black keys), starting from Midle C to C one octave above, which when pressed, plays the frequency of that specific note through the piezzo buzzer, lights up the LED, and displays the key being played on the LCD.

**Note:** At times, the simulation does not output any sound. Reloading the page usually solves this.
